# PeerQ

I created PeerQ as an alternative to the DevMountain Q system. It is an app for students to use to help other students, without seeing other students questions from other cohorts across the country.

## How?

I used many technologies when making this project including but not limited to: React | Redux | JavaScript(ES6) | SCSS | Sass | NodeJS | ExpressJS | Massive | PostgreSQL | Axios | Socket.io

### PeerQ is very simple to use:
